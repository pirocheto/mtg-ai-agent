However, it\u2019s possible for a game value, such as a creature\u2019s power, to be less than zero. If a calculation or comparison needs to use a negative value, it does so. If a calculation that would determine the result of an effect yields a negative number, zero is used instead, unless that effect doubles or sets to a specific value a player\u2019s life total or the power and/or toughness of a creature or creature card.\nExample: If a 3/4 creature gets -5/-0, it\u2019s a -2/4 creature. It doesn\u2019t assign damage in combat. Its total power and toughness is 2. Giving it +3/+0 would raise its power to 1.\nExample: Viridian Joiner is a 1/2 creature with the ability \u201c{T}: Add an amount of {G} equal to this creature\u2019s power.\u201d An effect gives it -2/-0, then its ability is activated.

Similarly, a spell may require alternative targets only if an alternative or additional cost was chosen for it. If the spell has a variable number of targets, the player announces how many targets they will choose before they announce those targets. In some cases, the number of targets will be defined by the spell\u2019s text.

The same target can\u2019t be chosen multiple times for any one instance of the word \u201ctarget\u201d on the spell. However, if the spell uses the word \u201ctarget\u201d in multiple places, the same object or player can be chosen once for each instance of the word \u201ctarget\u201d (as long as it fits the targeting criteria). If any effects say that an object or player must be chosen as a target, the player chooses targets so that they obey the maximum possible number of such effects without violating any rules or effects that say that an object or player can\u2019t be chosen as a target.

Its controller doesn\u2019t gain any life.\nExample: Plague Spores reads, \u201cDestroy target nonblack creature and target land.

Say the active player activates his creature\u2019s ability, it resolves, then the nonactive player activates her permanent\u2019s ability targeting that creature, and it resolves. This returns the game to a game state it was at before. The active player must make a different game choice (in other words, anything other than activating that creature\u2019s ability again). The creature doesn\u2019t have flying. Note that the nonactive player could have prevented the fragmented loop simply by not activating her permanent\u2019s ability, in which case the creature would have had flying.
